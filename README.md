# WeatherSand API

## Idea & Description

Have you ever had to open 2-3 applications to check the weather and mentally estimate the approximate temperature and the probability of precipitation? Well, I really hope so, because this node.js application provides a simple tool to retrieve the average weather forecast for the next 7 days for any location in the world(almost) from different sources. And so far there are 3 of them, but the number of data sources will grow.

This is a Fastify server application that serves as a REST API. It uses only two additional libraries - dotenv and undici (more info below). It can easily be integrated into any web or mobile application that requires weather data.

[A frontend app based on this API](https://github.com/marqpeo/WeatherSandApp)

## API usage

### Response type

All responses body will be a JSON object with the following fields:

```
{
	status: 'ok' OR 'error'
	results: a list of results (of cities OR forecast days)
	count: a number of results (the number of cities founded by passed query OR sources from which it was collected and processed the result forecast)
	error (optional): an error message if the status is 'error'
}
```


At the moment, this API has only two methods - "geocoding" and "get-weather-daily".

### üìç `/geocoding`
This method retrieves the longitude and latitude of the desired city by it's name. Allows to use as a language English, Spanish and Russian.

To retrieve them, make a GET request to `/api/geocoding` with the following queries:

| Parameter | Format | Required | Default |¬†Description |
| --------- | ------ | -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| name      | string | Yes      |         | String to search for city by the name |
| lang      | string | No       | `en`    | Return translated results, if available, otherwise return english or the native location name. Lower-cased. <br/> Options - `en`, `es`, `ru`|

Example - `/api/geocoding?name=Londres&lang=es`  ([try](https://weather-sand.onrender.com/api/geocoding?name=Londres&lang=es))

### ‚õÖ `/get-weather-daily`

This method retrieves the average weather forecast for the next 7 days for a given longitude and latitude.

To retrieve it, make a GET request to `/api/get-weather-daily` with the following queries:

| Parameter | Format.        | Required | Default |¬†Description |
| --------- | -------------- | -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| lat       | floating point | Yes      |         | latitude geographical coordinate of the location |
| lon       | floating point | Yes      |	      | longitude geographical coordinate of the location |

Example - `/api/get-weather-daily?lat=51.50853&lon=-0.12574`  ([try](https://weather-sand.onrender.com/api/get-weather-daily?lat=51.50853&lon=-0.12574))

## Dependencies
This application has only 3 dependencies:

  1. [fastify](https://github.com/fastify/fastify)
  2. [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) - Loads environment variables from .env for nodejs projects.
  3. [undici](https://github.com/nodejs/undici) - An HTTP/1.1 client, written from scratch for Node.js. In the project is used to fetch data from multiple APIs for calculating the result forecast.

## üóìÔ∏è Roadmap

- [x]   ~~Add localization for "geocoding"~~
- [x]   ~~Frontend app based on this API~~ - started
- [ ]  	Add hourly forecast
- [ ]   Add more API sources (up to 5 at this stage)
- [ ]   ? Start writing documentation [on the main page](https://weather-sand.onrender.com/)
- [ ]   ?
